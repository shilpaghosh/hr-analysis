Employee Data Analysis
======================

This HR analytics Tableau project is designed to offer HR managers and business leaders a comprehensive tool for analyzing and monitoring employee data, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions regarding employee retention, development, and recruitment.

The project includes trendlines and target lines to help track progress in reducing attrition, along with charts that display the distribution of employees and attrition rates by gender, age group, job satisfaction, and education field. Interactive filters and legends are integrated into the charts, allowing HR managers to drill down and explore the data in greater detail.
